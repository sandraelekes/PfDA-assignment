    "NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a Python library for working with multi-dimensional arrays. It was created by Travis Oliphant in 2005, by  merging  Numarray  into  Numeric. NumPy has evolved since, and became open source essential library for data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python.\\\n",
    "NumPy provides a convenient Python interface for working with multi-dimensional array data structures efficiently. NumPy arrays have a fixed size and are homogenous, which means that all elements must have the same type, but on the good side it has the computational efficiency and low-memory footprint . [2] [3] "
